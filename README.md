RefsBerlin is a small open source app that displays the current american football game and referee fixtures within the AFCVBB football association (Berlin / Brandenburg). The app is written in Kotlin and uses a mixture of MVP and MVVM (databinding); Dagger2, RetroFit and RxJava.

If you want to build & run the app you have to 
1. add your own `fabric.properties` file (or remove any Crashlytics stuff from the code)
2. add your own `ApiKey` property (send me a message if you need one)
